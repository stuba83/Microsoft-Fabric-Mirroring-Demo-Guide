-- Purpose: Demonstrate soft DELETE operations for historical data preservation
-- ========================================

-- DEMO SCENARIO:
-- This script demonstrates how DELETE operations are converted to soft deletes
-- to preserve historical data for analytics in Microsoft Fabric OneLake.
-- Shows the power of maintaining complete data lineage for business intelligence.
